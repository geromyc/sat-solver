## Putting it all together
structures.h defines your CNF, Lit, Clause, and readDimacs.

solver.h declares your Solver type and its entire public+private interfaceâ€”importantly including all the little helpers you invoke.

solver.cpp actually implements each method you declared in the header.

main.cpp then does:

CNF F = readDimacs(in);
Solver solver(F);
bool sat = solver.solve();
With that split, each file compiles cleanly, and your build command (for example) becomes:


### How to run
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout 
```text
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp solver.cpp -o mySolver
```
