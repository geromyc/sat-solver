## Putting it all together
structures.h defines your CNF, Lit, Clause, and readDimacs.

solver.h declares your Solver type and its entire public+private interfaceâ€”importantly including all the little helpers you invoke.

solver.cpp actually implements each method you declared in the header.

main.cpp then does:

CNF F = readDimacs(in);
Solver solver(F);
bool sat = solver.solve();
With that split, each file compiles cleanly, and your build command (for example) becomes:


## How to run
##### Update your local files
```text
git checkout main
git pull
```
git checkout *branch name you are working on*

##### If you don't have the benchmark files in your local directory
```text
mkdir uf20-91
mkdir uf50-218
```
```text
cd src/SATLIB/
tar xzf uf20-91.tar.gz -C uf20-91
```
===OR===
```text
cd src/SATLIB/
tar xzf uf50-218.tar.gz -C uf50-218
```

```text
cd src/core/
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp solver.cpp -o mySolver
```

./mySolver ../SATLIB/folder_name/file_name.cnf
